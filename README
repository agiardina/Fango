What is Fango?
Fango is a minified (<1000 sloc) one-file MVC framework.

What does Fango mean?
Fango is an Italian word which means "mud".

Why did you name a framework in such a stupid way?
Did you prefer another (boring) cool name? Ruby, groovy, symphony and so on?
Anyway, as a developer I like to put my hands in the mud and I'm not afraid to get dirty myself
if I need it... don't you?

Why should I use a one-file framework?
Actually... you shouldn't!

Seriously!
Perhaps you can use your time to sketch up your next
great idea instead of learnig how to use a complicate framework. Or perhaps using a
one-file framework is better than not using any framework at all. Or, simply,
you just don't need any additional functionality than those ones fango gives you.

How can I test the ExampleApp?
Create a virtual host to point to ExampleApp/public. Create a mysql db called fango.
Install the messages.sql inside the sql folder.
